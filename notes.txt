lane markers
- once 3+ points defined for corner, auto-generate lane markings
    (if haven't already been edited)
- find avg angle from centre to points
- use cross product to find most extreme points
- from extreme angles, figure out points at least 3.35 m (3.5?) from corner
- also calculate tangent slope on circle
- project tangent [X] m forwards or backwards to form lines

design vehicles
- 2 options: superimpose or one at a time
superimpose:
- checkboxes for each vehicle
- draw each vehicle path in a different translucent colour
one at a time
- radio buttons to choose design vehicle
- disable if turn not possible?
- warning for vehicle speed for non-selected?

path spline
- will define back of vehicle or trailer
- 4-th degree Bezier spline
- end points will be offset from beginning/end of lane markers
- 2nd and 4th points will be parallel to lane markers (for smoothness)

simulator
- get steering input based on spline path (maybe some kind of interpolation will be necessary for performance)
- ode solve to get centreline path and orientations
- find front overhang and rear wheel locations

illustrator
- take overhang and wheel locations, turn into polygon

optimizer
- obj function: minimize path length
- constraints:
  o does not intersect circle (radius - closest distance)
  o does not exceed max steering angle (limit - dmax)
  ? does not cross lane lines? (or should this be put into objective fn somehow?)
